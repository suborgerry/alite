You can add the necessary symbols to the cart on website.","question_2":"What happens if the nanofilm is scratched?","answer_2":"It is quite difficult to damage the Ecoslick® sticker because it is attached very firmly, forming an almost inseparable bond with the license plate. Even if there are scratches, it will be very difficult for the speed camera to determine which symbol is covered.","question_3":"What happens to the nanofilm after washing?","answer_3":"Ecoslick nanofilm is not afraid of washing, any type of car wash. The film is almost impossible to tear off with water pressure. Therefore, be extremely careful and precise when gluing.","question_4":"Is it necessary to put a film on the rear license plate of a car?","answer_4":"Depending on the terrain, speed cameras may be located in two directions and will record your car from both sides.

It is in the infrared spectrum that automatic speed cameras operate. It is against this spectrum that Ecoslick® film acts.","question_9":"What does the camera see when using nanofilm?","answer_9":"The camera only sees the illuminated area where the symbols are hidden under the Ecoslick® stickers, which blends into the white background. Accordingly, the digital system does not recognize the number and does not record it in the database of traffic violations. There is no one to give a fine!","question_10":"Does nanofilm work during the day?","answer_10":"The infrared beams of speed cameras work both day and night.","question_11":"Why should I buy your product?","answer_11":"Our Ecoslick® nanofilm is manufactured in Germany and is therefore reliable and effective.
